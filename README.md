## React Environment - last updated 5/6/19

This is a React Environment I created that includes React, Babel, SASS, and Webpack.  I wanted a clean working dev environment I could copy for a new project.

#### How to use:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build` to create a production build (includes minification)
3. Run `npm run start` to run the webpack-dev-server and see changes as you do them.

#### Notes:
- Uses the Webpack 4 default minimizer (Terser).
- JS is not minimzed when in dev mode.
- Uses React 16 and Webpack 4.
- Is using AirBnB stlye guide for eslinting.
